Machine Learning Assignments:
1. Diabetes Linear Regression
    * Use the Sklearn Diabetes Dataset and build a linear regression model
    * Main Tools: 
      * Linear Regression
      * Sklearn
      * Train/Test/Split
      * Matplotlib

2. Diabetes Model Comparison
    * Use the Sklearn Diabetes Dataset and perform Data Exploration. Then build a linear regression model, a decision tree model, and random forest model. Tune the models and evaluate the results to determine the best model and its parameters.

      * Linear Regression
      * Decision Tree
      * Random Forest
      * GridSearch
  
3. Titanic SVM
    * Use the Titanic Dataset and perform Data Exploration. Clean the data and train a logistic regression model, a support vector machine model, and stochastic gradient descent model. Tune the models using a grid search and evaluate the models
    * Main Tools:
      * SVM
      * Logistic Regression
      * SGD
      * Confusion Matrix
      * ROC Curve and AUC
      * Pipeline
